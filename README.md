## Installation

* Do not clone; make this directory by [installing the top-level directory](https://github.com/Bio3SS/top/blob/master/README.md)
* Set up an imageDrop
	* Put Dushoff's 3SS Dropbox into ~/Dropbox/3SS _or_
	* Put it elsewhere and link to it (see local.mk in Makefile) _or_
	* make your own Dropbox called 3SS and see what happens (things in webpix should be fetched, unless some links outdated; not sure what will happen with my_images)
	* some hybrid (you might want webpix to _not_ be a Dropbox for example, and just use my_images Dropbox)

## Making

_This directory is under development, but intro stuff should be make-able_

make:
* _unit_.draft.pdf for draft slides
* _unit_.final.pdf for final slides (with pauses, and less markup)
* _unit_.handouts.pdf for handouts
* _unit_.complete.pdf for complete notes

This seems to just work for intro.draft.pdf

## Updating

Knock yourself out, particularly with `intro.txt`
